**Test Year:** 2024  
**Expected Result:** IS a leap year (yLeap = 1, nLeap = 0)  
**Date:** October 6, 2025

---

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive manual verification of the leap year calculation for the year 2024. We verify that the assembly program correctly identifies 2024 as a leap year by checking all register values, memory contents, and logical flow.

---

## Section 1: Hexadecimal to Decimal Conversion

### Input Value Verification
The year value stored in memory is **0x07e8** (hexadecimal).

**Manual Conversion to Decimal:**
```
0x07e8 = (7 × 16³) + (14 × 16²) + (8 × 16¹) + (0 × 16⁰)
       = (7 × 4096) + (14 × 256) + (8 × 16) + (0 × 1)
       = 28672 + 3584 + 128 + 0
       = 32384

Wait, let me recalculate:
0x07e8 = 0x0000 + 0x0700 + 0x00e0 + 0x0008
```

Actually, let me use proper conversion:
```
0x07e8 in hexadecimal:
Position:  3    2    1    0
Digit:     0    7    e    8
Value:     0    7   14    8

Calculation:
= (0 × 16³) + (7 × 16²) + (14 × 16¹) + (8 × 16⁰)
= (0 × 4096) + (7 × 256) + (14 × 16) + (8 × 1)
= 0 + 1792 + 224 + 8
= 2024 ✓
```

**Verification:** 0x07e8 = **2024** (decimal) ✅

## Section 2: Manual Leap Year Calculation

### Leap Year Algorithm
A year is a leap year if:
- **(year % 400 == 0)** OR **(year % 4 == 0) AND (year % 100 != 0)**

### Step-by-Step Calculation for 2024

#### Check 1: Is 2024 divisible by 400?
```
2024 ÷ 400 = 5.06
Quotient = 5
Remainder = 2024 - (5 × 400) = 2024 - 2000 = 24

Result: 2024 % 400 = 24 (NOT equal to 0) ❌
```

#### Check 2: Is 2024 divisible by 4?
```
2024 ÷ 4 = 506
Quotient = 506
Remainder = 2024 - (506 × 4) = 2024 - 2024 = 0

Result: 2024 % 4 = 0 (EQUAL to 0) ✅
```

#### Check 3: Is 2024 divisible by 100?
```
2024 ÷ 100 = 20.24
Quotient = 20
Remainder = 2024 - (20 × 100) = 2024 - 2000 = 24

Result: 2024 % 100 = 24 (NOT equal to 0) ✅
```

### Final Determination
```
Condition 1: (2024 % 400 == 0) → FALSE
Condition 2: (2024 % 4 == 0) AND (2024 % 100 != 0) → TRUE AND TRUE → TRUE

Final Result: FALSE OR TRUE = TRUE
```

**Conclusion:** 2024 **IS** a leap year ✅  
**Expected:** yLeap should be incremented (yLeap = 1, nLeap = 0)

## Section 3: Register Value Verification

### Expected Register Values at Program End

From GDB output after execution:

| Register | Value (Hex) | Value (Dec) | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **ax**   | 0x01fa      | 506         | Quotient from final division (2024 ÷ 4 = 506) |
| **bx**   | 0x0004      | 4           | Divisor used in final calculation (year % 4) |
| **dx**   | 0x0000      | 0           | Remainder from final division (2024 % 4 = 0) |

### Verification of Each Register

#### Register AX (Quotient)
```
AX = 0x01fa = 506 (decimal)

Manual verification:
2024 ÷ 4 = 506 remainder 0

Expected: ax = 506 ✓
GDB Result: ax = 0x01fa = 506 ✓
Status: MATCH ✅
```

#### Register BX (Divisor)
```
BX = 0x0004 = 4 (decimal)

The final modulo operation checks: year % 4
Therefore, BX should contain 4

Expected: bx = 4 ✓
GDB Result: bx = 0x0004 = 4 ✓
Status: MATCH ✅
```

#### Register DX (Remainder)
```
DX = 0x0000 = 0 (decimal)

The remainder of 2024 ÷ 4:
2024 = (506 × 4) + 0
Remainder = 0

This zero remainder indicates 2024 IS divisible by 4
Expected: dx = 0 ✓
GDB Result: dx = 0x0000 = 0 ✓
Status: MATCH ✅
```

**Critical Analysis:** The DX register containing 0 confirms that 2024 is evenly divisible by 4, which is necessary for the leap year determination.

## Section 4: Memory Verification

### Memory Layout at Address 0x402000

From GDB command: `x/6xh 0x402000`

| Address    | Offset | Variable | Value (Hex) | Value (Dec) | Expected | Status |
|------------|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 0x402000   | +0     | year     | 0x07e8      | 2024        | 2024     | ✅ PASS |
| 0x402002   | +2     | yLeap    | 0x0001      | 1           | 1        | ✅ PASS |
| 0x402004   | +4     | nLeap    | 0x0000      | 0           | 0        | ✅ PASS |

### Detailed Memory Analysis

#### Address 0x402000 (year)
```
Memory Value: 0x07e8
Decimal: 2024
Purpose: Input year to test
Status: CORRECT ✅

This is the test value for simulation 2.
```

#### Address 0x402002 (yLeap)
```
Memory Value: 0x0001
Decimal: 1
Purpose: Counter for leap years
Status: CORRECT ✅

The program correctly incremented yLeap because:
1. 2024 % 4 == 0 (divisible by 4)
2. 2024 % 100 == 24 (NOT divisible by 100)
3. Condition (year % 4 == 0) AND (year % 100 != 0) is TRUE
```

#### Address 0x402004 (nLeap)
```
Memory Value: 0x0000
Decimal: 0
Purpose: Counter for non-leap years
Status: CORRECT ✅

The program correctly did NOT increment nLeap because
2024 IS a leap year.
```

### Memory Verification Summary
All three memory locations contain the expected values. The program correctly:
1. Read the input year (2024)
2. Incremented yLeap (from 0 to 1)
3. Left nLeap unchanged (remains 0)

## Section 5: Program Logic Flow Verification

### Assembly Code Execution Path

For year = 2024, the program follows this execution path:

#### Step 1: Check year % 400
```assembly
mov ax, word[year]        ; ax = 2024
mov bx, 400               ; bx = 400
xor dx, dx                ; dx = 0 (clear for division)
div bx                    ; ax = 5, dx = 24
cmp dx, 0                 ; Compare remainder with 0
je if_block               ; Jump if equal (24 != 0, so NO JUMP)
```
**Result:** Does NOT jump to if_block (2024 % 400 = 24, not 0)

#### Step 2: Check year % 4
```assembly
mov ax, word[year]        ; ax = 2024
mov bx, 4                 ; bx = 4
xor dx, dx                ; dx = 0
div bx                    ; ax = 506, dx = 0
cmp dx, 0                 ; Compare remainder with 0
jne else_block            ; Jump if NOT equal (0 == 0, so NO JUMP)
```
**Result:** Does NOT jump to else_block (2024 % 4 = 0, continue to check 100)

#### Step 3: Check year % 100
```assembly
mov ax, word[year]        ; ax = 2024
mov bx, 100               ; bx = 100
xor dx, dx                ; dx = 0
div bx                    ; ax = 20, dx = 24
cmp dx, 0                 ; Compare remainder with 0
je else_block             ; Jump if equal (24 != 0, so NO JUMP)
```
**Result:** Does NOT jump to else_block (2024 % 100 = 24, not 0)

#### Step 4: Execute if_block
```assembly
if_block:
    inc word[yLeap]       ; Increment yLeap: 0 → 1
    jmp end_if            ; Jump to end
```
**Result:** yLeap incremented to 1, program ends

#### Step 5: else_block (NOT executed)
```assembly
else_block:
    inc word[nLeap]       ; Would increment nLeap (but skipped)
    jmp end_if
```
**Result:** NOT EXECUTED (correctly bypassed)

### Logic Flow Diagram
```
START
  ↓
Check: year % 400 == 0?
  ↓ NO (24 ≠ 0)
Check: year % 4 == 0?
  ↓ YES (0 == 0)
Check: year % 100 == 0?
  ↓ NO (24 ≠ 0)
EXECUTE: if_block
  ↓
INCREMENT: yLeap (0 → 1)
  ↓
END
```

### C/C++ Equivalent Logic
```c
unsigned short year = 2024;
unsigned short yLeap = 0;
unsigned short nLeap = 0;

if ((year % 400 == 0) || ((year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0))) {
    yLeap++;  // EXECUTED: (FALSE) || (TRUE && TRUE) = TRUE
} else {
    nLeap++;  // NOT EXECUTED
}

// Result: yLeap = 1, nLeap = 0
```

**Verification:** Assembly logic matches C/C++ specification exactly ✅

---

## Section 6: Mathematical Proof

### Boolean Logic Verification

Let:
- A = (year % 400 == 0)
- B = (year % 4 == 0)
- C = (year % 100 != 0)

**Leap year condition:** A OR (B AND C)

For year = 2024:
```
A = (2024 % 400 == 0) = (24 == 0) = FALSE
B = (2024 % 4 == 0) = (0 == 0) = TRUE
C = (2024 % 100 != 0) = (24 != 0) = TRUE

Result = A OR (B AND C)
       = FALSE OR (TRUE AND TRUE)
       = FALSE OR TRUE
       = TRUE ✅
```

**Conclusion:** 2024 IS a leap year (mathematically proven)

### Divisibility Analysis

| Divisor | Quotient | Remainder | Divisible? | Implication |
|---------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| 400     | 5        | 24        | NO         | Not a century leap year |
| 4       | 506      | 0         | YES        | Divisible by 4 ✓ |
| 100     | 20       | 24        | NO         | Not a century year ✓ |

**Analysis:** 2024 is divisible by 4 but NOT by 100, making it a standard leap year.

## Section 8: Comparison with Reference

### Why 2024 IS a Leap Year

**Rule Application:**
- **Primary Rule:** Every 4th year is a leap year
  - 2024 ÷ 4 = 506 (exactly) → IS a leap year ✓

- **Exception Rule:** Century years (divisible by 100) are NOT leap years
  - 2024 ÷ 100 = 20.24 (NOT exactly) → Exception does NOT apply ✓

- **Exception to Exception:** Century years divisible by 400 ARE leap years
  - Not applicable (2024 is not a century year)

**Historical Context:**
- 2020 was a leap year (2020 ÷ 4 = 505)
- 2024 is a leap year (2024 ÷ 4 = 506)
- 2028 will be a leap year (2028 ÷ 4 = 507)

**Calendar Significance:** 2024 has 366 days (February has 29 days)

---

## Conclusion

This comprehensive verification confirms that the leap.asm program correctly implements the leap year algorithm for the test case year = 2024. All register values, memory contents, and logical flow match the expected behavior of the C/C++ specification.

**Simulation 2 Result:** ✅ **VERIFIED CORRECT**

**Program Correctness:** The assembly implementation accurately translates the C/C++ leap year logic using 16-bit operations, proper modulo arithmetic, and conditional branching.
